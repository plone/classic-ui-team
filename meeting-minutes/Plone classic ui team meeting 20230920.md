# Plone classic ui team meeting 20.09.2023

## Plone 6.1 alpha?

- Maik: New picture variant "mini". Will be done this week.
- resource registry conditions: conditions do not work yet, there is a bug to be resolved. https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/issues/3789 this should be fix asap
- plone.classicui schould be part of Plone 6.1 and include the new color mode viewlet


### Release cycles

For ClassicUI we do not need long support on 6.0.x.  You should move to 6.1 once it is out.  Can't Volto 16 be used on 6.1 as well?  But security support should be okay.
There should not be breaking changes in 6.1.  Sure, it can happen if we are not careful, but it is not what we intend.
